The earliest direct evidence of visual art and music hovers around 75-50,000 years ago and primarily takes the form of preserved cave paintings, sculptures and bone flutes. The oldest indirect evidence of pigment grinding and mixing however dates back to approximately 400,000 years ago, we just don't know what was being painted. It is plausible enough that paintings were just being made outdoors or as body art and because all paintings from this period were water soluable they naturally wouldn't have been preserved. Cave paintings are all water soluable too and are so sensitive they get damaged when people breath on them. Really it's amazing that we have any preserved pre-historic paintings at all. And indirect evidence that proto-humans valued objects purely for thier aesthetic qualities goes back even further, to one of the strangest art historical objects of all time, the Makapansgat Cobble. It's a small stone that appears to have a face that was carried around seemingly for several generations by a group of Australopithecus 2.8 million years ago. It's horrifying."

This is super inaccurate, the oldest evidence of visual art is found in East Africa and South Africa. Often we only have the implements of pre-historic African art production or incomplete artworks as the oldest examples, wheras many of the oldest European works have been shockingly well preserved. This might just be due to differences in geology, with Europe simply having more caves whose walls were better suited to preserving paintings. But there's also a better than good chance that European nationalism and concepts of historical narrative also played some kind of role in this descrepency. In any case when we learn about the origins of art history books often start by focusing on European cave paintings because we have so many well preserved examples of them, but archaic proto-humans were clearly making visual art at least 200,000 years before anyone in Europe, even if most of it hasn't been preserved."
